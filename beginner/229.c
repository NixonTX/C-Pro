/* DMA -Dynamic Memory Allocation. 
    ~ Memory allocated at the run time.
    ~ Memory can be allocated & deallocated at runtime according to your programming needs.
    ~ Memory can be reused.
    ~ Need Pointer.
    ~ Always remember to free the memory from the pointer once you're done.
    ~ Memory dynamically allocated from the Heap.
        ~ malloc()
        ~ calloc()
        ~ realloc()*/

/* SMA -Static Memory Allocation.
    ~ Memory allocated at the compile time.
    ~ Compiler is pre-defined for howmuch memory is to be allocated to a certain variable & those memory allocated to a certain variable.
    ~ Fixed, cannot modify during runtime.
    ~ Does't require a pointer.
    ~ Wastage of memory.*/
