/*
Certainly! Here are some problems related to one-dimensional arrays in C that you can practice with:

5. **Sorting**: Implement sorting algorithms like 
Selection Sort, or 
Insertion Sort to 
sort an array in ascending or descending order.

6. **Frequency Counter**: Count the frequency of each element in an array and print the results.

7. **Duplicates**: Check if an array contains any duplicate elements.

8. **Prime Numbers**: Create an array of prime numbers within a given range.

9. **Histogram**: Given an array of values, create a histogram (bar chart) that displays the frequency of each value.

10. **Rotations**: Rotate the elements of an array to the left or right by a specified number of positions.

11. **Subarray Sum**: Find subarrays in an array that sum to a given target value.

12. **Missing Number**: Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

13. **Leaders in an Array**: An element is called a "leader" if it is greater than or equal to all the elements to its right. Find and print all leaders in an array.

14. **Stock Buy-Sell**: Given an array of stock prices, find the best time to buy and sell to maximize profit.

15. **Remove Duplicates**: Remove duplicate elements from an unsorted array.

These problems cover a range of concepts and challenges related to one-dimensional arrays in C. They're great for practice and improving your problem-solving skills in C programming.
